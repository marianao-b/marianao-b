## Introduction: Optimizing the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/Oha/Pages/index.aspx) Website for Mental Health Services

The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) website places little to no emphasis on how to attain mental health services. With suicide in the top 10 causes of death in this state ([reference](https://visual-data.dhsoha.state.or.us/t/OHA/views/Oregonannualtrendsinmortality/TrendsDash?:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y)), this is alarming. Although mental health services cannot singlehandedly solve the problem, I believe their accessibility is crucial. The goal is to make crisis hotlines, counseling services and counseling information readily available so that people who are in need of help are not met with frustration the moment they decide they are ready to reach out.



### Design statement: 
The site's most pressing issue is organization; most mental health services are burried by series' of quick links making it diffuclt for anyone who is seeking help to attain it. If the Oregon Health Authoirty website made mental health services more accessible by creating a more efficient path to jump from the main page to information about crisis and counseling services. It would also benefit the user to have a search bar or a search assistant to find crucial services without having to go through any trouble.


## Competitor analysis

### [Heuristic Evaluation](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%2001/Assignment%201:%20Heurisitc%20Evaluation%20of%20Oregon.gov.md)

Before beginning to understand the way users navigate any website, is the responsibility of the user experience researcher to avaluate the usability of a website by via heursitic principles; this is called a heursitic evaluation. I analyzed the OregonEligibility webiste through the following principles <br> 
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

The severity of every principle the site did not satisfy was rated ona scale of 0 (not critical) to 3 (the presence of the issue impedes the user from using the site correctly).

### [Usability Testing](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%2002/%20Pilot%20UT:%20Oregon%20Health%20Authority.md)
I did my original heuristic evaluation on the OregonEligibility site, but I am choosing to continue with my project by working with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) website. The purpose of this usability testing is still very similar. I want to make sure that emergency mental health services and information on mental health services in general are easily accessible to those in need. According to the OHA, suicide is amongst the top 10 causes of death in Oregon, and I believe the state should make it easier for people to find and access information regarding mental health services for themlsves or a loved one. People should not be faced with frustration when seeking help.

## [User research](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%2003/Contextual%20Inquiry.md)
The goal of my project would be to support users accessing crisis hotline/management information as well as counseling services. To begn tis processm I conducted a contextual inquiry to better undertsand the way users themselves navigate the [OHA](https://www.oregon.gov/Oha/Pages/index.aspx) site. 

For this contextual inquiry, I identified the target user to be anyone over the age of 15 given the suicide rate staticts of the state of Oregon. Further, I conducetd a test with someone who fit th descrition of a target user where they had to complete a task which theoreteically would fulfill the following from Maslow's pyramid of needs:<br>
1. **Safety**:	Being able to access mental health services may serve as an aid for individuals still learning to cope with emotional baggage. Not only will it provide some emotional security, but improvement in emotional health can and oftentimes does translate into improvement in physical health (citation)
2. **Love and Social Belonging**: Having access to a variety of mental health services, or merely being able to navigate getting help may contribute to a user's sense of social belonging. Perhaps getting the help they need (or may not know they need) will strengthen familial, and friendly relationships and facilitate both platonic and romantic intimacy. When users who suffer from any mental illness do such a thing, they may create a support system for themselves which allows them to navigate the complexities of their mental health without resorting to suicice
3. **Esteem**: Further, I believe my proposed activity will tap into high-esteem for users. They may feel a greater responsibility to take care of themselves if the information is easily accessible and readily available. Perhaps receiving the care they need, or knowing they took a step in doing so, can help foster independence, confidence and strength

## [UX storytelling](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%2004/Persona%20%2B%20Scenario.md)

The purpose of UX story telling is to use empathy to idenitfy ciritical issues in the user expereince of any given app or website. By doing so, researchers and designers can understand how they can make their products better to serve their target audience and help them rather than stress them out as they navigate confusing websites. 

For this portion of my work, I developed two hypthetical characters who fit the target user description and basic demographiccs: Maria and Mateo. Both persona's were designed to test a feature I designed to make the website ore accessible. Each persona had a scenario and journey map to follow given the task they would hypothetically complete in order to test their respective features.

##  Wireframe and graphic design element variation

### [Wireframes](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%2005/Low%20Fidelity%20Prototype.md)
The purpose of this project is to make this website more user-friendly on mobile device platforms, specifically for smartphones. This will allow target users a fatser and more efficient way of searching for and scheduling counseling services and accessing crisis service in times of need. I developed three low-fidelity protype screens based on the data I collected throuhout my user research. Each screen is organized to emphasize three differnt tasks/ features: <br>
1. Finding crisis setvices
2. Finding counseling services
3. Using a ChatBot
##### *ChatBot is a 24-hour assitant optimized to help the user search for information on the webpage using key words.*

### [Interface Design Draft](https://www.figma.com/file/7Z1M1BWsyReR32XkZcOrk5/Interface-Design?node-id=15%3A64)
The proposed design is optimized for mobile devices to make crisis and counseling services informartion available on portable platforms to imjprove accessibility away from larger, stationary devices like a personal computer. It was also madein both light and dark modes.

## [Low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%2006/Interface%20Design.md)
My priority for the low-fidelity protoype was developing a default home screen and a dark mode home screen. The protype was designed o an iPhone 13 Pro frame using the [OHA](https://www.oregon.gov/Oha/Pages/index.aspx)homepgae as the starting point. In [this](https://www.figma.com/file/7Z1M1BWsyReR32XkZcOrk5/Interface-Design) version of the protype, the OHA homepage has mental health and crisis services as its focal point.

## [High-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/marianao-b/DH-110/tree/main/Assignments/Assignment%2007)
The protoype I developed allows users to find contact information regarding counseling services and contact a suicide hotline in case of an emergency. Other features that would be included if this project were to be continued include

* A ChatBot: An automated assistant to help users find resources they are unaware of by asking basic questions regarding their needs
* Dark mode: All features available on an interface designed for an environemnt with dim lighting.

## Reflection: Then, now & next steps

I came into this course with no knoweldge about Github, Figma, and other wireflow tools we used in this course. Throughout the durarion of this project, I leared 3 major user experience research and design skills:<br>
1. Conducitng pilot usability testing sessions
2. Creating and conducting contextual inquiry sessions
3. Low and high fidelity prototyping

After conducting my first usability testing session anad analyzing my data, I found great information regarding my target user but I also found that I could have been more warm and welcoming with my participant. Upon reflecting, I documented the following:
> I found it challenging to hold back as I saw the user overlook the information they were asked to find... I caught myself intervening... [I] could have tampered with the outcome of my study.

When I was conducting my contextual inquiry session, I used what I had learned from the pilot ut and was able to put the participant at ease. However, while conducting the contextua inquiry session, I feel I lacked the ability to provide clear instructions once I reviewed the data. From both of the sessions I conducted with a participant, I was able to observe my interpersonal skills and learned how to be patient and comforting while understanding the value of conciseness when providing instructions. Overall, I feel this project helped me improve my ability to speak to others when in a position of authoirty or something of the sort and urged me to think about conducting sessions from the perspective of the participant, similar to the way good UX designers modify designs from the perspective of the user.

On the more technical side, I learned Markdown, and how to protype using Figma. Learning markdown was one of the more simpler tasks I had to complete to follow-through with this porject, but it was one of the most useful skills given that I was able to document the research and prototyping process of the OHA mental health serrvices webpage and built a portfolio to document my work. I also learned to work with figma, from wireflows to creating components unique to my protypee and creating a flow of interactions to making the protype semi-usable. In the future, I would like to have more practice with Figma in regards to design; most of my choices were made based on what I have learned in this course but I think I can create a more efficient protype using design to emphasize the taska dn services I wanted to for this proeject if I can gain more knowledge regarding figma and design theory. Further, I would like to work more with protyping in general; my prototype is only optimized for one task and I know with more time I would be able to create a higher functioning prototype.
